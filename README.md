# FurFinder

**FurFinder** is a web-based platform designed to help pet owners to locate their lost pets (only cats and dogs for now). It provides a centralized space for creating lost-pet threads, reporting sightings, and accessing resources to aid in the search effort. The platform offers user authentication, enabling secure login with options like Facebook accounts for increased credibility. Key features include automatic thread updates, notification system for potential witnesses, a thread map with marked locations, and (hopefully) a missing pet flyer generator. FurFinder aims to leverage community engagement and self-designed algorithms to maximize the chances of reuniting lost pets with their owners.

## Project Description

Who is it for?
- The missing pet tracking web app is for pet owners who have lost their cats or dogs (losers) and for other users who want to help locate missing pets (finders).
    
What will it do? (What "human activity" will it support?)
- Generally, our web app facilitates the activity of searching for and locating missing pets by enabling information sharing between losers and finders.

What type of data will it store?
- The site will store data including but not limited to user information, threads, pictures, text, and geolocations.

What will users be able to do with this data?
- Users will be able to create and browse lost pet threads, view and upload pictures and textual descriptions, and report possible sightings.

What is some additional functionality you can add/remove based on time constraints?
- Providing an option for users to subscribe to email or push notifications for updates on relevant lost pet threads.
- Implementing a reporting system for inappropriate or false information.

## Project Task Requirements
